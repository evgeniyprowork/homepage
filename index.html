            <p class="about_text">
              I am an American investor, business tycoon, philanthropist, and
              the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. I am considered one of
              the most successful investors in the world. I look at each company
              as a whole, so i choose stocks solely based on their overall
              potential as a company. Holding these stocks as a long-term play,
              I don't seek capital gain, but ownership in quality companies
              extremely capable of generating earnings. When i invest in a
              company, I am not concerned with whether the market will
              eventually recognize its worth. I am concerned with how well that
              company can make money as a business.

                  I started selling Juicy Fruit chewing gum packs. When asked
                  for 1 piece, i would not sell as i thought i may be left with
                  4 pieces i could not sell. I made 2 cents profit per pack. I
                  would also purchase Coca-Cola six packs for 25 cents from his

                  At 11 years old, i buy my first stock – 6 shares of Cities
                  Service (now known as CITGO – an Oil company) at $38 per
                  share. I bought 3 for myself and 3 for my sister Doris. That
                  is all the money i had at that time. Practiced little to no
                  diversification at a young age which i continued to do
                  throughout my investment career. The stock price fell to $27
                  but soon went to $40. I sold the stock at $40, but, the stock
                  shot up to $202 in the next few years. I later cited this
                  experience as an early lesson in patience in investing.
